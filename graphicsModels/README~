This folder contains the blends and object files used for my class projects in graphics.

The images are not mine. They were found through google. 

Planets
cubes 
spheres
cylinders
Air Hockey Boards
Pucks
Paddles
Labyrinth Boards

Note: The brightness is pumped up in the mtl files due to the lighting that I implemented in my shaders. The Lights were multiplied by the mtl values, but then scaled for multiple lights. It was simpler for me to have large values in the mtl files and alter the values of the lights and shaders than to try and recreate Blender's lighting
